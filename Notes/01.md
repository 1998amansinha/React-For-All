### **1. Using Plain HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Plain HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

- In this approach, you directly use an `h1` tag within the HTML structure to display "Hello World."
- It's static and doesn't involve dynamic changes or programming logic.

---

### **2. Using JavaScript**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Using JavaScript</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <script>
      let heading = document.createElement("h1");
      heading.textContent = "Hello World";

      let root = document.getElementById("root");
      root.appendChild(heading);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- **Steps:**
  1. **Create an Element:** Use `document.createElement()` to create an `h1` tag dynamically.
  2. **Set Content:** Add the desired text using `innerHTML` or `textContent`.
  3. **Append the Element:** Use `appendChild()` to inject the newly created element into the desired part of the DOM.
- This approach allows for dynamic content manipulation and interaction with the DOM programmatically.

### **3. Using React**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Using React</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>

    <script>
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      const heading = React.createElement(
        "h1",
        { id: "heading" },
        "Hello World Using React"
      );
      root.render(heading);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

# Understanding React CDN Links

### **React Script Tag**

- **Purpose**: The React script tag imports the core **React library**.
- **What it contains**: A large amount of JavaScript code that provides the functionality of React as a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces.
- **Use Case**:  
  React provides the components, hooks, and declarative methods required for building powerful and reusable UI elements. It's primarily concerned with defining the _what_ (logic) of the UI.  
  Example: Writing JSX and using React features like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

### **ReactDOM Script Tag**

- **Purpose**: ReactDOM allows React to interface with the **browser's DOM**.
- **Why it's separate**: React itself is a library for building UI, but it doesn't assume you're working with a browser. The ReactDOM library bridges that gap and makes React work with web browsers.
- **Different Platforms**:
  - For **web browsers**, we use **ReactDOM**.
  - For **mobile applications**, we use **React Native**.
  - Other platforms could have different libraries for interfacing React with specific environments.

### **CDN and CORS**

- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):**

  - Distributes content through multiple servers globally.
  - Ensures fast access by directing users to the nearest server.
  - Helps handle high traffic efficiently.

- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**
  - Allows data sharing between two different servers (origins).
  - For example, when a frontend application (hosted on one server) needs to fetch data from an API hosted on another server, CORS ensures this is possible while maintaining security.

### **React and ReactDOM**

Purpose of the two script tags for **React** and **ReactDOM**. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **React**:

   - Core library for building UI components.
   - Focuses on logic, state management, and declarative rendering.

2. **ReactDOM**:
   - Bridges React with the DOM.
   - Handles rendering React components to the web browser.

### **Key Difference**

1. **React**: Provides the library to create React components and manage their state, logic, and lifecycle.
2. **ReactDOM**: Manages how React components are rendered into the browserâ€™s DOM (for web applications). It also provides methods like `ReactDOM.render()` or `ReactDOM.createPortal()`.

# Understanding React.createElement()

```javascript
const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Hello World Using React"
);
```

`React.createElement` is a core function of React that is used to create React elements. These elements are **JavaScript objects** that represent a piece of the UI. They are not HTML elements themselves but serve as a blueprint that React uses to update the DOM.

#### **Syntax of `React.createElement`**

```javascript
React.createElement(type, props, children);
```

1. **Type (First Argument):**

   - Specifies the type of element to create, such as `div`, `h1`, `p`, or a React component.
   - Example: `'div'` for a `div` tag or a functional/class component.

2. **Props (Second Argument):**

   - An object containing attributes or properties to assign to the element.
   - Common properties:
     - `id`, `className`, `style`
     - Event handlers like `onClick`
   - Example: `{ id: "heading", className: "main-heading" }`

3. **Children (Third Argument):**
   - Specifies the content or child elements of the element.
   - Can be:
     - A string (e.g., `"Hello World"`)
     - Another React element
     - An array of React elements
   - Example: `"Hello World"` or an array of nested elements.

---

### **Example 1: Simple `h1` Element**

```javascript
const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Hello World Using React"
);
```

#### Explanation:

- **Type**: `"h1"` specifies that an `h1` tag will be created.
- **Props**: `{ id: "heading" }` sets the `id` attribute of the `h1` tag.
- **Children**: `"Hello World Using React"` is the content of the `h1` tag.

**At this stage, `heading` is a **React element object**, not an actual DOM element. It will look like this:**

```javascript
{
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    id: "heading",
    children: "Hello World Using React"
  }
}
```

#### Rendering the Element:

To convert this React element into an actual DOM element:

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);
```

- `ReactDOM.createRoot` creates a React root in the specified DOM container (`#root`).
- `root.render(heading)` renders the React element into the real DOM, converting it into an actual `<h1>` tag.

---

# React Basics and Nested Elements

### **Example 2: Nested Elements**

```javascript
const nestedElement = React.createElement(
  "div",
  { id: "parent" },
  React.createElement("h1", { id: "child" }, "Nested Heading")
);
```

#### Explanation:

- The parent `div` contains an `h1` child.
- The `h1` has its own attributes and content.

**Rendered DOM Output:**

```html
<div id="parent">
  <h1 id="child">Nested Heading</h1>
</div>
```

## Example 3: Nested Elements

### Code:

```javascript
let parent3 = React.createElement(
  "div",
  { id: "parent" },
  [
    React.createElement("div", { id: "child" }),
    [
      React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World Using React"),
      React.createElement("h2", {}, "Hello World Using React2"),
    ],
  ],
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child2" }),
  [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World Using React"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "Hello World Using React2"),
  ]
);
```

### Rendered DOM Output:

```html
<div id="parent3">
  <div id="child">
    <h1 id="heading">"Hello World Using React"</h1>
    <h2 id="heading2">"Hello World Using React2"</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="child2">
    <h1 id="heading">"Hello World Using React"</h1>
    <h2 id="heading2">"Hello World Using React2"</h2>
  </div>
</div>
```

## React Elements vs DOM Elements

### React Element:

- Created using `React.createElement`.
- A plain JavaScript object describing the UI structure.

#### Example:

```javascript
{
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    id: "heading",
    children: "Hello World"
  }
}
```

### DOM Element:

- The actual rendered element in the browser's DOM.
- Created only after the React element is rendered using `ReactDOM.render`.

### Nested Elements in React:

- Using `React.createElement` can lead to verbose and less readable code when dealing with nested structures.
- Arrays are used to pass multiple children in a single parent.

---

## React's Core Features

### Introduction of JSX:

- JSX simplifies writing and managing React components by allowing us to use syntax similar to HTML.
- Eliminates the need for manually calling `React.createElement`, making code cleaner and more intuitive.

### React's Key Advantage:

- Unlike traditional HTML or vanilla JavaScript, React avoids full page reloads for every action.
- Updates only the required portions of the DOM, reducing computational costs and enhancing performance.

### Virtual DOM:

- React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize updates, ensuring only necessary changes are applied to the real DOM.
- This algorithm will be discussed in detail later.

---

## Why React is Considered a Library

### React is a Library:

1. **Selective Usage**:
   - React can be integrated into specific sections of an app (e.g., button, card, or form).
2. **Modular Nature**:
   - Allows building reusable components, which can be incrementally added to existing projects.
3. **Lightweight and Flexible**:
   - By fetching the React CDN, you can use it alongside other technologies without being constrained to a full application architecture.

### Why Not a Framework?

- Frameworks enforce a specific structure (e.g., Angular) and dictate how an app should be built.
- React provides tools for building user interfaces without dictating application structure, giving flexibility to choose tools for state management, routing, etc.

### Real-World Application:

- React can modernize legacy codebases by introducing dynamic components without requiring a complete rewrite.

---

## Summary

- React simplifies UI development with tools like `createElement` and `createRoot`.
- JSX enhances readability and maintainability of React components.
- React's Virtual DOM and incremental integration capability make it a versatile choice for modern applications.
